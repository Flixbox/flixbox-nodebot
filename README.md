[![Build and Test](https://github.com/Flixbox/flixbox-nodebot/actions/workflows/run.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Flixbox/flixbox-nodebot/actions/workflows/run.yml)

The lightbot solver is built on top of Vite 4.x and TypeScript. It generates a hybrid package - both support for CommonJS and ESM modules.

## Credits

- Most of the regex is from Bing AI.
- The individual levels have been downloaded from https://github.com/haan/Lightbot/blob/master/resources/maps/maps.txt

## Caveats

- Only a few levels have been implemented. The startig y-coordinates were garbled in the original data, and I only had the chance to fix a few of them.
- There is a limited amount of tests and no negative test yet. Feel free to add more by adding the text files in ./test and adding them to test/commands.ts
